# VIZ
### A monetary data visualization platform for reducing the gap between retail and institutional investors, as well as democratizing financial information.

## Inspiration
We noticed a lack of financial literacy and understanding in novice investors further increasing the gap between institutional and retail investors. We realized that with the proper resources and engagement, we can make financial data analysis far less intimidating.

## What it does
VIZ is a platform on which novice investors can understand financial statements through visual mediums and experienced investors can share their take on balance sheets, income statements, etc. This allows for newer investors to gain a deeper understanding of good and bad signs when looking at such data, and those with experience to gain a following.

## How we built it
VIZ is a Python web application built on the Flask framework with an HTML, CSS, JavaScript front-end and a Python, JQuery back-end.

## Challenges we ran into
We encountered challenges such as finding a way to relay information from backend to frontend, transferring data from a database to the user.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our biggest accomplishment was getting a Python script running on command through a web interface! We had to completely redesign our program to get it working, but it was well worth it.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about Python, Flask, and web development.

## What's next for VIZ
In the future, we plan on planning out front-end, back-end, and connecting the two before writing a single line of code! Seriously, having to redesign our whole presentation was painful.
